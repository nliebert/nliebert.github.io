My first computer was purchased by my parents for unknown reasons in 1992. They had very little interest in computing, and I was still in elementary school. That said, I was very happy to help unbox our Gateway 2000 4DX-33. I learned about software with this computer. It came with [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x), but most of the games I played still ran directly from DOS, and it was often easier to type commands than to figure out a graphical way to make the computer do what was needed. I played with QBasic, and remember friends sharing diskettes with games or program code. We played [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)) and [Gorillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)).

When I entered middle school we got a new computer, and I learned about hardware, swapping in a CD-R drive, adding a [Zip drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive), and expanding RAM. I set up a scanner. I waited patiently for our dial-up internet to connect, and was excited when I was able to upgrade our modem to a 56K model. I could fix basic problems with dot-matrix printers, like the one we had. Games kept advancing, but I was often just happy playing [Mindmaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta#Contents_and_features) that came with our copy of Encarta. When I wasn't helping my parents prepare documents or doing homework, I was playing interactive fiction games, my favorite of which is [Babel by Ian Finely](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=z5xgyw0jbt9r3ah1).

I got my first laptop when I went to college. I believe it was a Lenovo product, but honestly don't remember. What I do remember is the fact that I could do everything on a portable machine that I was able to do on a desktop machine. I got into Pascal programming, using a compiler I found online and the magical [Learn Pascal In Three Days by Sam A. Abolrous](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Pascal-Three-Days-Abolrous/dp/1556225679). I learned Java programming on [Solaris 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)). I graduated with a degree in Computer Science.

These days, I'm a computer hobbyist. I have a file server set up on a Raspberry Pi Zero, and a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running in a similar setup to a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64). I am typing this blog on a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex. I am working on a number of programs in [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)), [QB64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QB64), and [Liberty BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_BASIC). I look forward to sharing them on Github.
